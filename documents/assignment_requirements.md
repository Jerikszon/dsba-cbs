# Requirements outline DSBA assignment
**Roman Jurowetzki - Daniel Hain**

## Format

* Functional and self contained notebook
* Happy to see GitHub repos (which you can use as your portfolio in the jobmarket)
* Project report (20-ish pages - max. 30)
* Some study relation (but that is debatable and not necessarily required)
* Report is a (semi/non) technical documentation. Think about a corporate censor that you try to inform

## Content

* Problem formulation with some practical and theoretical motivation (no huge literature discussion)
* Methodology (not a critical realist vs positivist discussion but some ideas about what can be concluded potentially)
* Data sourcing and pre-processing strategy
* Overall achitecture of the model(s)
* Modelling (incl. finetuning)
* Results
* Discussion / Conclusion

## Scope

* Uses different methods from the course (at least 2 modules) in a creative way
* Downloading data from kaggle/github and running an ML model is probably not enough for a good performance
* Creative combinations of methodologies, please:
    * combine financial data with social media data to look at equity development
    * extract information from text data and create networks. Use network indicators to supplement company data
* Evaluation will focus on correct application and communication of DS methods
* The level of "technicality" is as in the course with empasis on application and intuition, not on ML engineering / mathematics
* However, you will need to demonstrate insight into statistics on a level that is required to discuss your assignment e.g. interpret and discuss performance indicators, outline strategies for improvement e.g. under/oversampling
